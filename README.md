### Overview

This application solves the important problem of "What should we drink while we watch this movie?" A user can search for a movie and the application will return a suggested cocktail to pair with the movie. Both items are rendered to UI with results from the OMDB API and CocktailDB API, respectively.

### Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS/Bootstrap
- JavaScript/jQuery
- [OMBD API](http://www.omdbapi.com/)
- [theCocktailDB API](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php)
- Google Analytics

### Future Improvements

- "Reverse" search option so that a user can search for a beverage that then returns a suggested movie
- Options to exclude user specified spirits
- Showing multiple drink results for multiple options (themed movie nights, movie marathons, etc.)
